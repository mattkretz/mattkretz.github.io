In this post I will talk about regularity and why 
`std::regular<std::simd<int>>` needs to be `false` in order to preserve 
regularity at the level where it matters: equational reasoning.

destructor, default constructor, copy constructor, total ordering, and 
underlying type. [...]

depends on equational reasoning; unless types are known to be regular, few 
optimizations can be performed.

In other words we're looking at operations and their semantics on types. For 
example two objects `a` and `b` of type `int` can be compared (`a == b`), 
assigned (`a = b`), destructed (trivial), default constructed (`int a{};`), 
copy constructed `int a{b}` and there exists a total order defined by `a < b` 
(the latter is not included in `std::regular`). These are pretty basic 
guarantees, which we take for granted for builtin types of the language. (Well, 
if you consider `std::initializer_list<int>` a language type, you may be 
surprised that `std::regular<std::initializer_list<int>>` is `false`. But then 
again, initializer lists are not meant to be used in equations ðŸ¤·.)

## `std::simd` is meant to be used in equations

This is where the trouble with `simd<int>` begins. `simd<int>` is certainly 
meant to be used in equations. Why doesn't that imply `std::regular<simd<int>>` 
must be `true`? Short answer: because the equations apply to the `int` not the 
`simd<int>`.

Let me elaborate. Stepanov and McJones define e.g. *associativity* as *op(op(a, 
b), c) = op(a, op(b, c))*. Without the ability to test for equality, 
associativity cannot even be defined / tested. Nevertheless, intuitively (i.e. 
without considering any definitions â€” using our intuition from what we learned 
in school) everybody would likely identify `simd<int>` as associative. Why is 
that? Because we recognize that `(a + b) + c` yields the same result as
`a + (b + c)`. Hmm "same result"... How can I say that without regularity?

When writing an equation using `simd<int>` types, the mathematically important 
equation is the one expressed per element. The `simd<int>` as a whole has no 
meaning. Or, in the formalism introduced in EoP: a `simd<int>` object as a 
whole does not identify a single *entity*; a `simd` type is not a *value type*.

The `simd` abstraction is a tool for expressing the same equation on multiple 
`int` objects in parallel. It's a tool for manipulating multiple entities â€” a 
tool for applying operators/operations on multiple entities in parallel. 
Therefore, equational reasoning must work on the level of `int`s. Thus, in 
order to prove associativity of a single SIMD lane of `int`s, equality must be 
testable on a per-element basis. This is exactly what the status quo `simd` 
paper does. It therefore implements regularity for the *value type*. The 
alternative implies that the comparison result of a different SIMD lane 
(unrelated element) influences the result of other elements.

## What if `std::regular<std::simd<T>>` were `true`?

To answer this question, consider the basic code transformation underlying the 
`std::simd` design. The design intent of `std::simd` is to replace e.g. a loop 
over 16 `char`s with one `simd<char, 16>` chunk:

```c++
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i) {  // 16 times do:
      char x = text[i];             //   load 1 character
      x = unscramble(x);            //   unscramble 1 character
      text[i] = x;                  //   store 1 character
    }
```
becomes:
```c++
    std::simd<char, 16> x(text.begin()); // load 16 characters
    x = unscramble(x);                   // unscramble 16 characters
    x.copy_to(text.begin());             // store 16 characters
```

where `unscramble` could be:
```c++
auto unscramble(auto x) {
  // always flip bit 0b0010;
  // flip bit 0b0001 if x has bit 0b1000 or 0b0100 set
  return x ^ (2 | ((x & 0b1100) != 0));
}
```

Let's now embed either the loop or the `simd<char, 16>` solution into a simple 
`main` function:
```c++
int main() {
    std::string text = "pfdvocp\"fmwjwjfq\n";
#if USE_LOOP
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i) {
      char x = text[i];
      x = unscramble(x);
      text[i] = x;
    }
#else
    std::simd<char, 16> x(text.begin());
    x = unscramble(x);
    x.copy_to(text.begin());
#endif
    std::cout << text;
}
```

- With `USE_LOOP=1` the program prints **"regular entities"**.

- With `USE_LOOP=0`:

  - If `simd::operator==` returns `bool` (i.e. `true` only if all elements are 
    equal; and `!=` is `true` if any element compares not equal), then the 
    second program prints **"segul\`s!entitier"**.

  - However, if `operator==` is not reduced to a single `bool`, returning a 
    `simd_mask`, then the second program prints **"regular entities"** (status 
    quo of the current "merge `simd` from the TS" paper).

Making `simd` itself regular breaks equational reasoning on the level of the 
`simd` elements. Making `simd` regular at the level of the `simd` elements 
enables generic code, composition, equational reasoning, and thus allows 
applying equational optimizations developed for the element type.

## Alternative: `simd` should not overload any comparison operators

If `simd::operator==` returning `bool` is such a foot-gun in terms of silently 
introducing logic errors into the code, and `simd::operator==` returning 
`simd_mask` is considered unacceptable (because `operator==` should only ever 
return `bool` and nothing else), then why not remove all comparison operators 
and use free functions instead? For example, instead of `a == b` write 
`std::simd_equal(a, b)`?

While, technically, this seems like a workable compromise, it still breaks 
regularity of the value types contained in the `simd`. Consequently, according 
to the definition of associativity, `std::simd<int>` would not be associative 
anymore: there is no equality operator to establish equality of the LHS and 
RHS.

Furthermore, this breaks generic code. This compromise is going against the 
basic design principle of `simd` that, as much as the language allows, 
vectorization of an algorithms should only require a change of type from `T` to 
`simd<T>`. Now, generic code â€” i.e. also code that doesn't use `simd` â€” needs 
to be written with `std::simd_equal` in place of `==`. The next logical step 
would then replace `simd_mask::operator&&` with `std::simd_logic_and`. And the 
generic overload for `bool` arguments would then have to break 
short-circuiting.

It has been stated that `simd` should not overload any operators at all, 
because `==` isn't regular (or because `simd` itself isn't a *value type*). 
It's probably a solution in the sense that `std::simd` adoption would simply 
not happen and thus not ever confuse anybody. ðŸ˜‰

## Conclusion
We have to choose one of the following:

1. `std::regular<std::simd<T>>`: Making `simd` itself regular silently breaks 
   generic code, because equational reasoning on the level of the 
   `simd::value_type` is broken.

2. No `operator==` overloads at all: Not implementing any comparison operators 
   makes generic code dependent on a different syntax for equational reasoning.

3. Regularity of the `simd` elements: Keeping regularity of `simd::value_type` 
   intact breaks the use cases where users want to use `simd` as a product type 
   (where `simd` itself is a *value type*). However, it allows using `simd` as 
   a tool for expressing parallel evaluation of equations that can be reasoned 
   about on the `simd::value_type` level using the concepts introduced in 
   "Elements of Programming".

In most cases, using `std::simd` as a product type is *wrong* in the sense that 
it doesn't help with expressing data-parallelism for higher performance. In 
many cases the use of `std::simd` as a product type trades the use of SIMD 
instructions for ILP (instruction level parallelism), resulting in a slowdown 
rather than performance improvement. Therefore, the `std::simd` API tries to 
discourage such uses. Consequently, `std::regular<std::simd<T>>` must be 
`false`.
